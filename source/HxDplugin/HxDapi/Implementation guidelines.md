# Implementation guidelines

## Byte order handling / Endianness

The bytes passed to BytesToStr() and those returned from StrToBytes() are
assumed to be in the architecture's preferred byte order. Since HxD runs on
x86-32 and x86-64, and therefore the plugins as well, this is little endian.

If the data type does not support the machine's default byte order, the only
valid one supported by the data type should be returned. If the data type has a
fixed byte order, this one should be returned.

UTF-8 for example has a fixed byte order, since the lead byte always comes
first, and the trail bytes also have a fixed order, depending on their value
(i.e., it is always clear if it is a first, second or third trail byte from the
value). UTF-16 is byte order sensitive however, because it is an array of UInt16
values, which can be in little or big endian order.

ChangeByteOrder() is called to convert the machine / data type's default byte
order to the target one, as selected in the data inspector (see the byte order
radio buttons).

In other words, if ChangeByteOrder() is called with NewByteOrder =
boLittleEndian, you can return without doing anything, since Bytes will be in
the correct order already. If you want to keep it platform neutral, you can add
a test for the machine endianness, and do nothing in ChangeByteOrder() calls,
when its NewByteOrder parameter matches the machine's endianness.

If a data type does not support byte reordering (like UTF-8 or x86 assembly), it
should take care to set SupportedByteOrders accordingly, in the constructor
function CreateConverter() or the constructor for the object oriented interface.

## String formatting according to the user's locale

BytesToStr() and StrToBytes() should be locale dependent, despite using wide
character strings (i.e., UTF-16).

This is because the locale defines not only a default multi byte character set
(not relevant here since we use UTF-16), but also formatting options, for
floating point numbers, time formats, currencies, and more. A common example are
locale specific decimal separators in floating point numbers: e.g., a
comma for most European countries vs. a period for English speaking nations.

Therefore, it is important to use locale dependent conversion functions, or
write your own using the Windows API (or wrappers around it).

The right locale can be obtained from the Windows API GetThreadLocale(). Check
if whatever libraries you use do that internally, already.

### Handling of white space

The Str passed to StrToBytes() can contain leading or trailing white space. This
has to be skipped if the data type allows it. For example leading and trailing
white space is ok for integers and can be trimmed. But it should not be trimmed
for string or character data types, otherwise it will be impossible to enter a
space for a character type converter, for example.

BytesToStr() should not return white space that has no meaning. I.e., a
character type converter might return a whitespace character, but an integer
type converter should not (as it would merely be additional padding).

### Flexible (but not overaccepting) input syntax

In general, it is important that the strings produced by BytesToStr() can be
parsed by StrToBytes(). Ideally, StrToBytes() is more accepting of special
ways to format data, rather than being strictly limited to the set of strings
created by BytesToStr().

For example, an integer type converter should skip leading or trailing
whitespace -- as in "  123  " --, to ease user input. It should however not try
to fix ill formated strings and remain predictable (e.g., it should not be over
accepting by skipping trailing letters that are invalid for an integer, such as
"123 more text").

Another example of being reasonably accepting is allowing input text to be case
insensitive, where it makes sense. Floats can contain an E to denote an
exponent: "123E4", which means 123*10^4 (10^4 = 10 to the power of 4). It should
not matter whether this exponent is in upper ("123E4") or lower case ("123e4").
Similarly, for hexadecimal integer values: "1A2B3C4D" and "1a2b3c4d" should both
be treated as valid encodings of the same value.

## Converting from and to hexadecimal numbers

Hexadecimal numbers should always be treated as unsigned, even if you make a
datatype converter for a signed integer type. Assuming you make an Int32
converter, a string representing a hexadecimal number such as "80000000" would
cause a range error, since the largest positive number for Int32 is 2147483647
(7FFFFFFF in hexadecimal).

You should detect such error cases in StrToBytes(), and then use an unsigned
conversion function and a type cast, instead.

When converting BytesToStr() negative values should still map to an unsigned
hexadecimal value.

Refer to the C and C++ examples, which handle this correctly and explicitly. The
Delphi example handles this correctly as well, but it is done implicitly by
Delphi's RTL.

## Predefined localized text for messages / GUI output

HxD 2.5 introduces *string variables*, to provide commonly used strings in localized/translated versions. Ideally, this eliminates the need for translating texts for each plugin.  
  
(Why introduce a new/different formatting style at all? To avoid conflicts, when you pass strings containing string variables to formatting functions, inside of your plugin. Or in other words, once traditional formatting functions are called within your plugin, all formatting specifiers are gone, so HxD would have no chance to replace the string variables.)  

The syntax is as follows:  
`{s:<StrVarName>(Param0, Param1, Param2, ...)}`  
Similar to formatting of strings with printf/Format functions, the {s:...} pattern will be replaced by the translated/localized string.
Parameters (ParamX) act like %s in formatting strings. More specifically, parameters are position dependent/indexed, so, for example, Param0 will act like %0:s.  
  
Parameters are always given as strings, delimited by double quotes ("). If the parameter should contain a double quote itself, it has to be escaped by writing it twice, i.e., to escape " write "".  

**Example:**  
`{s:Disassembly("6502")}`  
corresponds to a traditional formatting string like this:  
`SDisassembly = 'Disassembly (%0:s)'`  
and will appear to the user in the GUI as:  
`Disassembly (6502)`  
If the GUI language is German, it will show up in the GUI like this:  
`Disassemblat (6502)`  
  
**Example with escaped double quotes:**  
`{s:Disassembly("""6502""")}`  
will appear to the user in the GUI as:  
`Disassembly ("6502")`  
  
Finally, here is the list of string variables available in HxD 2.5 (and later):  

| Name        | Value - English (USA) | Value - German (Germany)   | ... (other languages) |
|:------------|:----------------------|:---------------------------|:----------------------|
| Bitwidth    | %d bit                | %d Bit                     | ...                   |
| Binary      | Binary (%s)           | Bin√§r (%s)                 | ...                   |
| Date        | %s date               | %s Datum                   | ...                   |
| Time        | %s time               | %s Uhrzeit                 | ...                   |
| TimeDate    | %s time & date        | %s Uhrzeit & Datum         | ...                   |
| Disassembly | Disassembly (%s)      | Disassemblat (%s)          | ...                   |

## Which standard C/C++ type conversion function to use?

### Short version

Use strtol/wcstol (and similar). See str2int() and str2uint() in CStrUtils.c for
correct wrappers that take care of all the necessary subtleties. A str2float()
would use strtof/wcstof in a similar way, to handle single precision floats.

### Longer version

Functions of the atoi family have undefined behavior in case of invalid strings.
std::stoi uses strtol internally and throws exceptions, which adds unnecessary
overhead, since we cannot let them escape out of the DLL.
std::from_chars is ASCII only, and therefore not suited (all the strings passed
by HxD are wide strings). It also does not handle locale specific formatting,
which is important as well (e.g., decimal separator in floats).
sscanf / swscanf and istringstream are a bit heavy weight, and also not as easy
or reliable to detect errors conditions.

Instead use a function of the strtol family (or in our case wcstol,
for wchar_t*) as exemplified by the wrapper functions str2int() and str2uint()
in CStrUtils.c.


## Which standard Delphi type conversion function to use?

Delphi's (Try)StrToInt/(Try)StrToFloat already respect the locale and handle
widestrings fine. (Try)StrToInt also properly handles hexadecimal values as
unsigned, even if the input is a signed integer. There are similar functions for
other basic data types, eventhough you are likely to have to write your own ones
for special data types, where the notes above matter (respecting locale,
flexible input syntax, etc.).
